You can't give a team the quality of Wales the opportunity to enter into your defensive zone, because they will make you pay for it.\"\nThe Ireland coach added: \"I said to the players in the changing room 'it's going to be very tough next week'.\n\"They (England) are going to look to rebound from a slip-up in France, and they are going to bring a really physical performance to Twickenham to lay down a marker prior to the World Cup, and we are going to have to walk in there and man-up and do the best we can.\"\nMeanwhile, Ireland skipper Paul O'Connell was disappointed that his final international appearance on home soil ended on a losing note.\n\"There are certain things we wanted to improve on from the Scotland game, and we probably didn't do that. From our point of view that is disappointing,\" said the second row.\n\"There are some things that we pride ourselves on, and we didn't do a whole lot of those very well, with discipline being one of them.\"\nSummary: Ireland coach Joe Schmidt has given an initial positive fitness bulletin about wing Keith Earls after he was carried off with a head injury during the 16-10 defeat by Wales in Dublin on Saturday.\n\nArticle: {document}\nSummary:",
    "Summarize the article.\n\nArticle: The team found patients who were given electrical stimulation alongside rehabilitation sessions fared better than people given rehab alone.\nVolunteers who had the electrical treatment saw greater improvements when moving their arms, and some found it easier to do everyday tasks.\nCharities welcomed the early results.\nThe study, published in the Journal of Science Translational Medicine, involved 24 people who had had strokes at least six months before the trial began and still experienced difficulties while moving their arms or hands.\nEach volunteer had nine sessions of intensive rehabilitation where they were encouraged to move their affected limbs.\nAnd for the first twenty minutes of each session 11 had additional therapy -  known as transcranial direct current stimulation - where electrodes were placed on the participant's scalp above the affected area of the brain, and a low current was applied.\nThe others had a dummy treatment - with just seconds of electrical stimulation before the machine was switched off.\nResearchers found all patients had improved - but the biggest improvements were seen in patients who had prolonged electrical stimulation.\nAnd improvements persisted three months after rehab stopped.\nOne patient, for example, found he could feed himself more easily after the treatment and others were better able to lift, grasp or reach for objects.\nBut improvements varied, partly depending on the severity of the initial stroke.\nAccording to brain scans, the group that had electrical stimulation also showed increased activity in regions of the brain related to movement.\nJan, a  study volunteer, said: \"I have definitely improved and benefited. People who haven't seen me say 'Wow - you can move better now'\".\nShe added: \"The stimulation didn't hurt - more like a mild tingle or a static electric shock right on top of my head. The worst part was that my head itched afterwards!\"\nLead researcher Prof Johansen-Berg, said she was excited by the results and hypothesised that the therapy worked by boosting the ability of the brain to re-wire after strokes.\nBut she cautioned more extensive trials were needed and said the benefits and costs would need to be weighed up before the programme could be offered in hospitals.\nShamim Quadir of the charity the Stroke Association said the study was an important step towards bigger trials.\nHe added: \"Stroke is one of the largest causes of disability and more than half of stroke survivors are left dependent on others for help with everyday activities.\n\"It is crucial that we find alternative ways to help improve the recovery rates from this devastating condition.\"\nSummary: Stimulating the brain with electrical current can help boost recovery after a stroke, research from the University of Oxford suggests.\n\nArticle: {document}\nSummary:",
    "Summarize the article.\n\nArticle: Jason Rezaian's case had been referred to a Revolutionary Court, Tehran Chief Prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi told the official Irna news agency.\nThe Washington Post said it hoped the referral represented \"a step forward toward Jason's prompt release\".\nMr Rezaian, who holds dual US-Iranian citizenship, was arrested with his wife and two associates in July.\nThe associates were released within weeks, while Yeganeh Salehi was freed on bail in October.\nIn December, Mr Rezaian was brought before a judge in the Iranian capital to hear charges officially levelled against him and was denied a request for bail.\nThe specific charges were not made public at the time, nor were they listed in the state media. Reports published on Wednesday evening quoted Mr Jafari Dolatabadi as saying the journalist's case had been sent to a Revolutionary Court for \"processing\".\nThe Washington Post said the phrase suggested that the charges against Mr Rezaian could be studied by the court before it decided whether to set a trial date or keep the case in a holding pattern.\nRevolutionary Courts mostly handles cases involving security offenses.\n\"We still do not know what charges the Iranian authorities have brought against our correspondent Jason Rezaian, but we hope the referral of his case to a Revolutionary Court represents a step forward toward Jason's prompt release,\" Martin Baron, executive editor of the Washington Post, said in a statement.\n\"This step gives Iran's judiciary an opportunity to demonstrate its fairness and independence by determining that the charges\u00c2\u00ad are baseless. We call on Iran to make these charges public, to allow Jason access to a lawyer and to bring a swift and just resolution of a six-month-long nightmare.\"\nMr Rezaian's mother had been able to see him twice at the end of December, Mr Jafari Dolatabadi said.\nMary Breme Rezaian told the Washington Post last month that her son \"looked very different\" and had lost 18kg (40lbs). He was also suffering from health problems, including an eye infection and back pain, she said.\nThe US state department has repeatedly raised the subject of Mr Rezaian's detention during negotiations with Iranian officials over the country's nuclear programme.\nBefore attending talks with US Secretary of State John Kerry in Geneva on Wednesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said he hoped the issue could be resolved.\n\"We will have to wait for the judiciary to move forward, but we will try to provide all the humanitarian assistance that we can,\" Mr Zarif said.\nSummary: A Washington Post journalist detained for almost six months in Iran is to stand trial on unspecified charges.\n\nArticle: {document}\nSummary:"
