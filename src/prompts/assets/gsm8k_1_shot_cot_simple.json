    "Answer the math problem.\n\nQuestion: Ivan has a bird feeder in his yard that holds two cups of birdseed. Every week, he has to refill the emptied feeder. Each cup of birdseed can feed fourteen birds, but Ivan is constantly chasing away a hungry squirrel that steals half a cup of birdseed from the feeder every week. How many birds does Ivan\u2019s bird feeder feed weekly?\nLet's think step by step\nThe squirrel steals 1/2 cup of birdseed every week, so the birds eat 2 - 1/2 = 1 1/2 cups of birdseed.\nEach cup feeds 14 birds, so Ivan\u2019s bird feeder feeds 14 * 1 1/2 = 21 birds weekly.\nThe answer is 21\n\nQuestions: {question}\nLet's think step by step",
