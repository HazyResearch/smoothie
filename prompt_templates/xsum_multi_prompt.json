You have little insight into your actions and the consequences for others. The maintenance of your innocence does neither of you any credit.\n\"You persisted in this wicked scheme for a period of almost three years, until the father was able to get to the truth. Had it not been for his determination there may well have been further damage to this child.\n\"The social work report says your conduct is likely to have caused lasting psychological damage, or at least trauma, to this child. You denied the father the opportunity to parent his child for a significant period of time.\"\nSummary: A mother who duped her former partner into thinking she had an abortion in order to give his child to her gay friend has been jailed for three years.\n\nArticle: {document}\nSummary:",
    "Summarize the article.\n\nArticle: The Old Bailey jury saw a transcript of the message left while the prince was at Sandhurst military academy.\nThe 2005 document was one kept by former NoW royal editor Clive Goodman, who denies misconduct in public office.\nHe is one of eight people who deny a series of charges. Five are former News of the World journalists.\nGoodman was jailed for phone hacking in 2007 and subsequently dismissed from his job.\nDuring Friday's prosecution opening statements, the court was also told:\nProsecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court that documents from Goodman's employment case against News International, which owned the now-closed NoW, had recently become available after he waived his legal privilege.\nGoodman kept the documents as evidence to show that what he had done had been sanctioned at a high level of the NoW, Mr Edis said.\nThe first document shown to the jury was a transcript of the voicemail message Prince Harry left on the mobile phone of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton, an ex-SAS man serving as his private secretary, in which the prince asked for information about the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege in London.\nThe transcript included the words: \"Just wondering if you have any info at all on siege on the Iranian embassy because I need to write an essay quite quickly on that. I need some inf. Have most of the stuff but if you have extra.\"\nMr Edis told the jury that the voicemail came to the attention of Goodman, who was interested in it as a potential allegation of misconduct to do with essay writing against Prince Harry.\nThe prince was doing his officer training when the events took place around December 2005.\nThe message was accessed by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who was jailed for phone hacking along with Goodman in 2007 and has admitted further phone-hacking charges.\nThe court heard there were discussions between Goodman and his boss, Mr Coulson, about how to run the Harry story without exposing its source.\nThey decided not to refer to the siege in their coverage as it would be \"too precise to get through unnoticed\".\nMr Edis said: \"Everyone would know that they hacked his voicemail because obviously Harry and Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton both knew that this voicemail was sent and received.\"\nMr Edis suggested to the jury that the reason Goodman had kept the emails was because of his arrest.\nGoodman's prosecution caused Mr Coulson, 45, who denies charges including conspiracy to phone hack, and others at News International to be \"extremely worried about what Clive Goodman would do, or say, in the course of defending himself\".\nMr Edis continued: \"We can see that they had every reason to be worried.\"\nThe court heard that concern about keeping Goodman \"on-board\" was also felt by Mrs Brooks when she was editor of the Sun.\nMr Edis told the jury about an email exchange between Mrs Brooks and Goodman in which she offered him a job shortly after he had been released from prison in 2007.\nThe court also heard that a source in the military had provided the Sun with a photograph of Prince William at a party while he was at Sandhurst.\nRead profiles of the eight defendants\nAn email from a Sun reporter to Mrs Brooks stated: \"My best contact at Sandhurst, who has provided a string of great stuff over a period of months, is offering us a picture of William at a James Bond party dressed as a Bond girl. He is wearing a bikini and an open Hawaiian shirt.\n\"The chap who has the picture wants \u00c2\u00a34,000 up front. It will open the door for future exclusives and info.\"\nThe newspaper did not run the photo.\nMr Edis told the court that Mrs Brooks personally authorised payments to an MoD official via a Sun journalist.\nHe said the only reason for the payments was to make sure the Sun got the story first and some involved the reporting of the deaths of members of the armed forces.\n\"Sometimes these payments were about things coming into public domain anyway,\" he added.\n\"In which case there was no good reason at all for the MoD source to accept money to leak them early. The only advantage of that was that the Sun would get the exclusive.\n\"It may concern the death of an active serviceman... it really matters when it is released and how it is released to other people affected by it.\"\nMr Edis said: \"Mrs Brooks was involved in a conspiracy to commit the criminal offence of misconduct in a public office - and she knew it.\"\nMrs Brooks denies conspiracy to phone hack, misconduct in public office, and perverting the course of justice.\nThe court has heard that three former News of the World journalists, who are not on trial, as well as Mulcaire, had pleaded guilty to phone-hacking charges.\nThe trial was adjourned until Monday.\nSummary: A voicemail message left by Prince Harry, in which he asked an aide for help with an essay, was hacked by the News of the World, a court has heard.\n\nArticle: {document}\nSummary:",
    "Summarize the article.\n\nArticle: The 29-year-old left the field after six minutes with his eyelid ripped open and underwent immediate surgery.\nHe had a second surgery on Monday and St Helens coach Justin Holbrook has given no indication of a return.\n\"He was cleared of any major damage but then had some other issues with it and has had more surgery,\" he said.\n\"I don't know any timeframe for his return; it's purely on how his eye responds to the surgery he's had.\"\nSmith suffered the eye injury in the narrow 24-22 defeat at Headingley after an accidental clash in a tackle with Saints captain Jon Wilkin.\n\"He couldn't get it stitched on the field on Friday because his eyelid was ripped,\" said Holbrook.\n\"But hopefully it will be sorted quickly and he'll be back very soon.\"\nIt is Smith's second setback of the season after suffering a broken leg before the start of the current campaign.\nHe has scored two tries in 16 appearances this season since his recovery but given there is no indication of a quick return, Holbrook has a replacement in mind.\n\"We should get a clearer indication on Matty in the next day or two,\" he told BBC Radio Merseyside.\n\"I've definitely thought about it (a replacement). We've got a young Danny Richardson at the club.\n\"He's had strong performances in our reserves and has had a few run outs with Sheffield at the Championship level, so it's more than likely he'll come straight in.\"\nSummary: St Helens scrum-half Matty Smith has required a second surgery on the eyelid injury he suffered against Leeds Rhinos on Friday.\n\nArticle: {document}\nSummary:",
    "Summarize the article.\n\nArticle: Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, better known as \"Ahok\", is accused of insulting Islam during election campaigning.\nOn Wednesday, Indonesian prosecutors confirmed his case could go to trial.\nMr Purnama is Christian and ethnic Chinese - a double-minority in Muslim-majority Indonesia, where ethnic Chinese are about 1% of the population.\nIn a surprise move, President Joko Widodo, a political ally of Mr Purnama, appeared at the gathering and listened to a sermon delivered by one of his own fierce critics, radical Islamic Defender Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab.\nAhead of the rally, police announced that they had detained eight people for suspected treason. The group includes the sister of former president Megawati Sukarnoputri and musician Ahmad Dhani.\nMr Widodo has blamed \"political actors\" of trying to take advantage of the furore over Mr Purnama to destabilise his government.\nThe BBC's Ging Ginanjar, at the rally, says organisers told police it would just be a public sermon and mass prayer, but many attendees are carrying banners condemning Jakarta's governor and calling for him to be jailed.\nA large protest against the governor on 4 November turned violent, leaving one man dead and dozens of police and demonstrators injured.\nIn a campaign speech in September, Mr Purnama said Islamic groups who were using a Koranic verse to discourage support for him were deceiving voters. The verse is interpreted by some as prohibiting Muslims from living under the leadership of a non-Muslim.\nIslamic groups said he had criticised the Koran and lodged complaints with the police.\nMr Purnama later apologised but denied committing blasphemy, which carries a maximum five year jail sentence. He has promised to continue campaigning for the governorship, a role he inherited when his predecessor Joko Widodo became president in 2014.\nThe election is to be held in February.\nPolice have said they will not arrest the governor, but he is barred from leaving the country while the case continues.\nWhile polls suggest the straight-talking governor's popularity has been hurt by the allegations, he is popular for his stances against corruption and in favour of public transport and greater access to healthcare and education.\nSummary: At least 200,000 conservative Muslims have gathered for Friday prayers and to protest against Jakarta's governor, at a rally in the Indonesian capital.\n\nArticle: {document}\nSummary:",
    "Summarize the article.\n\nArticle: As brands, embassies and media outlets compete to raise a chuckle with their sham announcements, here are some of 2017's best spoof stories.\nIf you believe the Irish Times, Dublin is to get its very own \"Trump Tower\". \"Trump Dublin is expected to be completed by the end of 2018,\" it exclusively revealed.\nExtra credit should go to whoever completed the joke with a fake tweet from Donald Trump: \"Bought a small tower in Dublin, Ireland. We are going to build an awesome hotel in Dublin. It will be totally great. Love Ireland! Great country! #trumpdublin\".\nInspired by claims that Kremlin-sponsored hackers tried to rig the US election, Russia's foreign ministry shared \"a new answering machine for Russian diplomatic missions abroad\" on Facebook.\n\"To arrange a call from a Russian diplomat to your political opponent, press 1,\" the fake switchboard message suggests. Your other options? \"Press 2 to use the services of Russian hackers\", or 3 \"to request election interference.\"\nThe scamps at the UK's German embassy tweeted that Germans would shortly vote to \"leave, or remain in\" Central European Time (CET). \"A replica of the Shepherd Gate Clock in Greenwich would be placed atop the World Time Clock in Alexanderplatz, Berlin, in a frivolous symbolic gesture,\" the writer deadpanned.\nThe clues were there for linguists, however - the surname of the \"government spokesperson\" quoted - Frau Sommerzeit - translates as \"Summertime\".\nEmirates airline almost had us going with the claim that it's planning to unveil a triple-decker plane. Why? Time zones. The UAE gets to 1 April before the UK and without that all-important date-stamp... could it possibly - somehow - be true?\nNo, is the answer. The Dubai-based carrier has not designed a plane including \"a swimming pool, games room, gym & park\". Our sympathies to the 6,800 excited people who re-tweeted that...\nMeanwhile in the Antipodes... Virgin Australia will be the first airline in the world to employ dogs as cabin staff, the company announced on Twitter.\nWhile less useful in an emergency, these little guys might have been a loveable distraction at 40,000ft.\nGoogle has clearly decided April Fool's pranks don't contravene its mantra \"Don't be evil\".\nThe tech giant got a head-start on its comedy competitors by revealing \"Google Gnome\" -  a sort of do-it-all outdoor assistant - ahead of the big day.\n\"Google Gnome is like having a tiny, little meteorologist at your beck and call,\" the GoogleStore claimed.\nThe sullen character \"comes programmed with the ability to take charge of your backyard tools,\" it enthused.\nOr, for the curious: \"Ask Gnome all kinds of questions, like: 'what's the difference between cirrocumulus and cumulonimbus clouds', 'why is humidity the worst', and, for windswept hair in summertime photo shoots, 'which way is the wind blowing'?\"\nThe jokers confessed in the small print: \"Google Gnomes are real, but only in our hearts - for now.\"\nNot to be outdone, Amazon breathlessly broke the news of \"Petlexa\" - allegedly an animal-friendly version of its voice-activated personal assistant, Alexa.\n\"Now your dog, cat, or favorite pet can communicate with Alexa just like you do,\" the firm promised, - even including an instructional video.\nReader, it was all a lie.\nThe BBC dipped a toe into the jovial April waters with a mocked-up BBC Three documentary, purportedly starring national treasure David Attenborough. The subject? Grime music.\nIf that seems unlikely to fool anyone, we'd like to introduce Stormzy, one of the urban genre's brightest stars, who fell for it hook, line and sinker.\nAccording to the man himself, he sent a savage direct message to BBC Three on Twitter, airing his views.\n\"Public apology,\" the red-faced MC confessed as the penny dropped.\nIn Scandinavia, some editors are concerned that in an era of outlandish, fact-free headlines, April Fool's Day stories could muddy the waters of truth even further.\nYulf Yahr-tenes, editor of the Bergen Times, one of Norway's largest papers, told the BBC it was time to take the journalistic high ground instead.\nMagnus Karlsson, editor-in-chief at the daily Smalandsposten in Sweden, agreed. In his view, April Fool's stories could be devastating for the credibility of local newspapers in particular - a price too high to pay for a quick-fire giggle.\nReaders inclined to their view might enjoy the following - our favourite \"weird but true\" stories from Fake News Day.\nSummary: On one day of the year \"fake news\" is only to be expected and this first of April is no different.\n\nArticle: {document}\nSummary:"
